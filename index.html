        <h6>Anno 222 A.G</h6>
        <p>
            <b>Entry I</b>
            Hark! I find myself upon the <b><i>shores of Titania</b></i>, a land spoken of with much repute. Rumors led mine ears to tales of a <b><i>grand castle</b></i> that doth stand as the heart of this realm.

            <b>Entry II</b>
            Verily, my quest to locate the castle proved treacherous, for in the mountainous lands of bitter cold and monsters, I found myself <b><i>stranded for months.</b></i> Seeking sanctuary within the mountain's bosom, the gods of these peaks bestowed upon me the providence needed for survival.
            
            <b>Entry III</b>
            Having endured the mountain's harsh embrace, I have named it <b><i>Mount Spectra</b></i> in homage to mine ancestors,and now, it is mine dwelling. As I prepare to descend to the lower realms of Titania, I do reflect upon the trials faced.
            
            <b>Entry IV</b>
            At last, mine eyes gaze upon the looming silhouette of the castle, a formidable presence visible from afar. With caution as my guide, I approach its gates.
            
            <b>Entry V</b>
            The castle, though grand, reveals an open portal, inviting mine exploration across its hallowed grounds.
            
            <b>Entry VI</b>
            A survey of the castle and its environs unfolds before me, yet the northern lands remain untrodden.
            
            <b>Entry VII</b>
            In my initial observations, I discern the presence of several individuals within the castle walls.Lords, mayhaps, governing this domain. Foremost amongst them is <b><i>Luis the Frank</b></i>, the master of the castle, overseeing its expansion.
            
            <b>Entry VIII</b>
            Other lords, in allegiance to Luis the Frank, I spy near the castle's domain. Further investigation is warranted to unveil their identities.
            
            <b>Entry IX</b>
            The lords adjacent to the castle appear to possess lands of their own. To the north, the overseer of Titania's village is the alchemically-inclined Lord, <b><i>the Master of Reins</b></i>, whose ways remain shrouded in mystery.
            
            <b>Entry X</b>
            Whispers reach mine ears of a lord hailing from the <b><i>Squirrel lands</i></b>, yet the details elude me. His identity and purpose remain obscured.
            
            <b>Entry XI</b>
            A warrior lord, clad in <b><i>armor resembling that of a frog</i></b>, captures mine attention. His name, a riddle unsolved, and his dominion unknown in the realms of Titania.
            
            <b>Entry XII</b>
            Having chosen a fertile land to cultivate, I embark on the arduous task of mapping these territories whilst delving into the affairs of the lords. A resource-intensive endeavor, yet a necessary one.
            
            <b>Entry XIII</b>
            Alas, the lords of Titania vanish from the castle, leaving naught but questions lingering in the air. The reason for their <b><i>disappearance</i></b> remains an enigma. Have they sailed to distant lands, leaving their dominion unmanned?
            
            <b>Entry XIV</b>
            The <b><i>"Vanishing of the Lords"</b></i> marks the year <b><i>222 A.G.</b></i>  in the annals of Titania. Evidence suggests the presence of at least two lords dwelling nearby, yet their fates remain unclear.
            
            <b>Entry XV</b>
            Exploring the castle surroundings, I uncover the identity of one lord with a fearsome bovine machine - <b><i>Johnny the Boy</i></b>, a lord of potential peril.
            
            <b>Entry XVI</b>
            The expansion of my farm complete, I stumble upon a winding path leading to an abode. Could this be the realm of the mysterious <b><i>Lord of Squirrels</b></i>?
            
            <b>Entry XVII</b>
            The path reveals the dwelling of another vanished lord to the <b><i>southwest</b></i>, adding another enigma to the unraveling tale.
            
            <b>Entry XVIII</b>
            Entering what may be the <b><i>elusive</b></i> Lord of the Squirrels' domain, I find no definitive proof. The search persists.
            
            <b>Entry XIX</b>
            Castle grounds, seemingly deserted, witness the return of Luis the Frank, evidenced by ongoing expansion. A chance for communication presents itself, though my attempts prove futile.
            
            <b>Entry XX</b>
            Months pass with no sign of the lords' return. I extend my territories and fortify my holdings.
            
            <b>Entry XXI</b>
            Upon my return, I discover <b><i>missing</b></i> livestock. Further exploration is warranted.
            
            <b>Entry XXII</b>
            Commencing the construction of a perimeter wall, I unearth a path leading northeast from my farm. A potential link to the vanished animals?
            
            <b>Entry XXIII</b>
            A <b><i>revelation</b></i> unfolds as I chance upon an edifice, well-kept and stocked. A new lord's domain, it seems, and I set camp to keep vigilant watch.
           
            <b>Entry XXIV</b>
            Despite the lords' continued absence, I fortify my perimeter and intensify illumination.
            
            <b>Entry XXV</b>
            To my surprise, the mysterious neighbor is none other than <b><i>Lord Semaan</b></i>, lost in a cave that exits onto my lands. A note reveals his plight and his house affiliation.
            
            <b>Entry XXVI</b>
            Contact established, <b><i>Lord Semaan</b></i> extends an invitation, and our fruitful discourse unveils his tale as an explorer stranded in these lands.
            
            <b>Entry XXVII</b>
            As the eve of a new year dawns, I, <b><i>Gen of House Spectra</b></i>, claim these lands of Titania as mine own. Yet, much labor remains.

        <h6>Anno 223 A.G</h6>
        <p> 
            <b>Entry I</b>
            Encountering an <b><i>unknown figure</b></i> near the castle waters, I seek information about the lords. The man, unidentified, speaks of the Lord of the Squirrels and a vessel under construction.
            
            <b>Entry II</b>
            Observing the vessel's progress, I discern a need for assistance. Infrastructure I provide, offering respite to the builder.
            
            <b>Entry III</b>
            The builder converses with another figure, possibly the elusive Lord of the Squirrels. I approach, seeking proximity to discern the truth.
           
            <b>Entry IV</b>
            The <b><i>Lord of the Squirrels</b></i> eludes me, departing once again. His lands remain a mystery.
            
            <b>Entry V</b>
            The drydock's completion aids the boat builder. Returning to my lands, <b><i>I ponder the lords' fate</b></i> and potential clues to their abandonment of the castle...
