###### Anno 222 A.G 

**Entry**
Hark! I find myself upon the <i>**shores of Titania**</i>, a land spoken of with much repute. Rumors led mine ears to tales of a <i>**grand castle**</i> that doth stand as the heart of this realm.

**Entry**
Verily, my quest to locate the castle proved treacherous, for in the mountainous lands of bitter cold and monsters, I found myself <i>**stranded for months**.</i> Seeking sanctuary within the mountain's bosom, the gods of these peaks bestowed upon me the providence needed for survival.

**Entry**
Having endured the mountain's harsh embrace, I have named it <i>**Mount Spectra**</i> in homage to mine ancestors,and now, it is mine dwelling. As I prepare to descend to the lower realms of Titania, I do reflect upon the trials faced.

**Entry**
At last, mine eyes gaze upon the <i>**looming silhouette of the castle**</i>, a formidable presence visible from afar. With caution as my guide, I approach its gates.

**Entry**
The castle, though grand, reveals an open portal, inviting mine exploration across its hallowed grounds.

**Entry**
A survey of the castle and its environs unfolds before me, yet the northern lands remain untrodden.

**Entry**
In my initial observations, I discern the presence of several individuals within the castle walls.Lords, mayhaps, governing this domain. Foremost amongst them is <i>**Luis the Frank**</i>, the master of the castle, overseeing its expansion.

**Entry**
Other lords, in allegiance to Luis the Frank, I spy near the castle's domain. Further investigation is warranted to unveil their identities.

**Entry**
The lords adjacent to the castle appear to possess lands of their own. To the north, the overseer of Titania's village is the alchemically-inclined Lord, <i>**the Master of Reins**</i>, whose ways remain shrouded in mystery.

**Entry**
Whispers reach mine ears of a lord hailing from the <i>**Squirrel lands**</i>, yet the details elude me. His identity and purpose remain obscured.

**Entry**
A warrior lord, clad in <i>**armor resembling that of a frog**</i>, captures mine attention. His name, a riddle unsolved, and his dominion unknown in the realms of Titania.

**Entry**
Having chosen a fertile land to cultivate, I embark on the arduous task of mapping these territories whilst delving into the affairs of the lords. A resource-intensive endeavor, yet a necessary one.

**Entry**
Alas, the lords of Titania vanish from the castle, leaving naught but questions lingering in the air. The reason for their <i>**disappearance**</i> remains an enigma. Have they sailed to distant lands, leaving their dominion unmanned?

**Entry**
The <i>"**Vanishing of the Lords**"</i> marks the year <i>222 A.G.</i>  in the annals of Titania. Evidence suggests the presence of at least two lords dwelling nearby, yet their fates remain unclear.

**Entry**
Exploring the castle surroundings, I uncover the identity of one lord with a fearsome bovine machine - <i>**Johnny the Boy**</i>, a lord of potential peril.

**Entry**
The expansion of my farm complete, I stumble upon a winding path leading to an abode. Could this be the realm of the mysterious <i>**Lord of Squirrels**</i>?

**Entry**
The path reveals the dwelling of another vanished lord to the <i>**southwest**</i>, adding another enigma to the unraveling tale.

**Entry**
Entering what may be the <i>**elusive Lord of the Squirrels**</i>' domain, I find no definitive proof. The search persists.

**Entry**
Castle grounds, seemingly deserted, witness the return of Luis the Frank, evidenced by ongoing expansion. A chance for communication presents itself, though my attempts prove futile.

**Entry**
Months pass with no sign of the lords' return. I extend my territories and fortify my holdings.

**Entry**
Upon my return, I discover <i>**missing**</i> livestock. Further exploration is warranted.

**Entry**
Commencing the construction of a perimeter wall, I unearth a path leading northeast from my farm. A potential link to the vanished animals?

**Entry**
A <i>**revelation**</i> unfolds as I chance upon an edifice, well-kept and stocked. A new lord's domain, it seems, and I set camp to keep vigilant watch.

**Entry**
Despite the lords' continued absence, I fortify my perimeter and intensify illumination.

**Entry**
To my surprise, the mysterious neighbor is none other than <i>**Lord Semaan**</i>, lost in a cave that exits onto my lands. A note reveals his plight and his house affiliation.

**Entry**
Contact established, <i>**Lord Semaan**</i> extends an invitation, and our fruitful discourse unveils his tale as an explorer stranded in these lands.

**Entry**
As the eve of a new year dawns, I, <i>**Gen of House Spectra**</i>, claim these lands of Titania as mine own. Yet, much labor remains.

###### Anno 223 A.G

**Entry**
Encountering an <i>**unknown figure**</i> near the castle waters, I seek information about the lords. The man, unidentified, speaks of the Lord of the Squirrels and a vessel under construction.

**Entry**
Observing the vessel's progress, I discern a need for assistance. Infrastructure I provide, offering respite to the builder.

**Entry**
The builder converses with another figure, possibly the elusive Lord of the Squirrels. I approach, seeking proximity to discern the truth.

**Entry**
The <i>**Lord of the Squirrels**</i> eludes me, departing once again. His lands remain a mystery.

**Entry**
The drydock's completion aids the boat builder. Returning to my lands, <i>**I ponder the lords' fate**</i> and potential clues to their abandonment of the castle...

###### Anno 224 A.G

**Entry**
Many a year hath pass’d since mine eyes last beheld the Castle of Titania, since the grievous hour known as the <i>*Vanishing of the Lords*</i>. I am but a humble mortal, bound by flesh and fleeting time, and have spent these years in mine mountainous keep, studying the *scholarly arts* in hope of discerning some arcane method by which the noble lords might yet be rescued from what seemeth a dread calamity.

**Entry**
Life upon this frozen mount beareth many hardships. The cold bites deep, and provisions scarce sustain. Yet through perseverance, I have raised an edifice not unlike the hydroponic hall once gifted to the castle of Titania. It hath sustained me through many a storm. On occasion, I voyage by water to mine seaside farm, wherefrom I import goods to ensure my survival.
**Entry**
Oft do I wonder what fate befell the halls of Titania. Dost the castle yet stand? Have the lords return’d in secret? I must make ready a journey to those lands, to bear witness with mine own eyes.

**Entry**
As I prepare for voyage, a troubling sight greets me from mine balcony; *smoke and fire* in the far distance. Even from here, that great tower, sentinel of Titania, is visible beneath the heavens. Could it be? Have the lords return’d at last; or hath some new peril taken root?

**Entry**
By water I draw near to the *Port of Titania*. Ash and ruin greet me. A vessel lies smoldering; burnt and broken, adrift and swallowed by flame. To starboard, a refuge doth sit; familiar, yet shrouded in shadow. Methinks it may be the same wraithlike figure I glimpsed in mine last venture. I shall approach with caution, for danger oft wears friendly guise.

**Entry**
From afar, the castle itself seemeth untouched. Yet nature reclaims what man forsakes; *overgrowth* entwines the earth, and the lights that once kept darkness at bay flicker faintly, their magic waning. I shall rekindle them, lest nightfall bring forth the beasts.


**Entry**
Signs of presence I have found. The *storehouses* lay barren, their bounty taken. Yet mine message, left long ago for the returning lords, remaineth unopened and undisturbed. Thus I doubt ‘twas any of the old lords who returned. Another hand hath plundered these grounds.

**Entry**
Grief heavies mine heart. I fear the noble lords—so bold in their questing—hath perished within the *Nether* or wandered beyond the veil in *The End*. Those cursed portals are tombs cloaked as gateways. Yet I shall return once more when the season turns, for I cannot abandon hope. But for now, I must take my leave, for mine own land calleth for care.

**Entry**
I am return’d to mine mountain home, where silence reigns and wind howls through stone. I shall tend to my fields and continue my *studies in the arcane*, holding fast to the faint hope that in my scrolls, or in some forgotten rune, there might be salvation for the *Lords of Titania*. Should the fates allow it, I shall find a way.


###### Anno 225 A.G

**Entry**
I have prepared for many moons to find clues about the fate of the lords of titania, all lead me to the neather dimension. So i have built a portal as described in the forbiden texts, i am ready i shall march onwards.

**Entry**
I have spent many moons in hell, the neather allows no sleep, do not now how much time passed while i was lost in the damned place. Anything of the overworld seldom lasts, these lands are of survival and dread. Had not been for my scholarly enchantments i sureley would have perished long ago, with luck i found a portal tha took me far away but out of the hellish realm.

**Entry**
I am lost, the portal has taken me to a unknown location, i have yet to find my bearings, my maps prove futile, ths land is unknown to me, i have no way of returning to my home, imust shelter on these lands or return thrue the portal.

**Entry**
Several days have passed, as i prepare to travel again to the nether, as i see no way of returning home thrugh the overworld. If my calculations are right, every metere i walked in the nether roughly translates to 8 meters in the overworld, i am at least 10,000 meters on any direction. It might take a lifetime to travel back...

**Entry**
In my attempt to research more of the arcane and find a way to discover the whereabouts of the lords of titania, i have become stranded, but one thing is certain, the lords o titania were in the nether, i found remnantes of their exploration.

**Entry**
Several a moon cycle has passed, ive yet to have all the resources to venture back into the neather, in my exploration of this lands i am now certain that the only way  home is through hell. I have walked many distances by water and foot and have proven futile venture. Luckyly the markings i left in the nether shall help me find my way to the original portal and not a pool of lava.

**Entry**
Today shall be the day a step through the portal, i have prepare for two moon cycles, explored these fringes of land and have come to the conclusion, the only way is the portal. if i shant survive whomever find this was my last entry and leave a copy on these lands if someone ever venture this far the frontier keep of Lord Gen of House Spectra..


###### Anno 226 A.G

**Entry**
I have lost track of time, in the neather there is no day or night only fire. It was wise to prepare for two moon cycles, some of the markings i left have vanished, taking longer but i recognize the hellish landscape. the gold i brought has proven of use, the pig like creatures appeart ignore me.

**Entry**
I am running thin on my supplies, the potions and enchantments protect me from this hellscape, food is running out but i have found that the mushroom like growths are adible but cause visions that test my sanity. I shall endure and return with my findings.

**Entry**
I have finally found the original path, i know the portal is close, enduring in these hellish realm has taken a toll on my sanity. I have lost track of time, completely. i just hope that time does not pass equally as distance while in this dimension.

**Entry**
I have return to my mountain keep, i do not know how many mooncycles have passed, i fear the neather distort time, i shall settle and explore my keep before and analyse my findings. and shall plan to travel to the clastle of titania the next season.

**Entry**
In these lands time flies faster than expected, it feels as if 50 years had passed, i am but an older man. I have forgoten my travels to the castle of titania, seaons have passed but more pressing matters have taken hold of me.
