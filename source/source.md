###### Anno 222 A.G 

##### Entry
Hark! I find myself upon the <i>**shores of Titania**</i>, a land spoken of with much repute. Rumors led mine ears to tales of a <i>**grand castle**</i> that doth stand as the heart of this realm.

##### Entry
Verily, my quest to locate the castle proved treacherous, for in the mountainous lands of bitter cold and monsters, I found myself <i>**stranded for months**.</i> Seeking sanctuary within the mountain's bosom, the gods of these peaks bestowed upon me the providence needed for survival.

##### Entry
Having endured the mountain's harsh embrace, I have named it <i>**Mount Spectra**</i> in homage to mine ancestors,and now, it is mine dwelling. As I prepare to descend to the lower realms of Titania, I do reflect upon the trials faced.

#####  Entry
At last, mine eyes gaze upon the <i>**looming silhouette of the castle**</i>, a formidable presence visible from afar. With caution as my guide, I approach its gates.

##### Entry
The castle, though grand, reveals an open portal, inviting mine exploration across its hallowed grounds.

##### Entry
A survey of the castle and its environs unfolds before me, yet the northern lands remain untrodden.

##### Entry
In my initial observations, I discern the presence of several individuals within the castle walls.Lords, mayhaps, governing this domain. Foremost amongst them is <i>**Luis the Frank**</i>, the master of the castle, overseeing its expansion.

##### Entry
Other lords, in allegiance to Luis the Frank, I spy near the castle's domain. Further investigation is warranted to unveil their identities.

##### Entry
The lords adjacent to the castle appear to possess lands of their own. To the north, the overseer of Titania's village is the alchemically-inclined Lord, <i>**the Master of Reins**</i>, whose ways remain shrouded in mystery.

##### Entry
Whispers reach mine ears of a lord hailing from the <i>**Squirrel lands**</i>, yet the details elude me. His identity and purpose remain obscured.

##### Entry
A warrior lord, clad in <i>**armor resembling that of a frog**</i>, captures mine attention. His name, a riddle unsolved, and his dominion unknown in the realms of Titania.

##### Entry
Having chosen a fertile land to cultivate, I embark on the arduous task of mapping these territories whilst delving into the affairs of the lords. A resource-intensive endeavor, yet a necessary one.

##### Entry
Alas, the lords of Titania vanish from the castle, leaving naught but questions lingering in the air. The reason for their <i>**disappearance**</i> remains an enigma. Have they sailed to distant lands, leaving their dominion unmanned?

##### Entry
The <i>"**Vanishing of the Lords**"</i> marks the year <i>222 A.G.</i>  in the annals of Titania. Evidence suggests the presence of at least two lords dwelling nearby, yet their fates remain unclear.

##### Entry
Exploring the castle surroundings, I uncover the identity of one lord with a fearsome bovine machine - <i>**Johnny the Boy**</i>, a lord of potential peril.

##### Entry
The expansion of my farm complete, I stumble upon a winding path leading to an abode. Could this be the realm of the mysterious <i>**Lord of Squirrels**</i>?

##### Entry
The path reveals the dwelling of another vanished lord to the <i>**southwest**</i>, adding another enigma to the unraveling tale.

##### Entry
Entering what may be the <i>**elusive Lord of the Squirrels**</i>' domain, I find no definitive proof. The search persists.

##### Entry
Castle grounds, seemingly deserted, witness the return of Luis the Frank, evidenced by ongoing expansion. A chance for communication presents itself, though my attempts prove futile.

##### Entry
Months pass with no sign of the lords' return. I extend my territories and fortify my holdings.

##### Entry
Upon my return, I discover <i>**missing**</i> livestock. Further exploration is warranted.

##### Entry
Commencing the construction of a perimeter wall, I unearth a path leading northeast from my farm. A potential link to the vanished animals?

##### Entry
A <i>**revelation**</i> unfolds as I chance upon an edifice, well-kept and stocked. A new lord's domain, it seems, and I set camp to keep vigilant watch.

##### Entry
Despite the lords' continued absence, I fortify my perimeter and intensify illumination.

##### Entry
To my surprise, the mysterious neighbor is none other than <i>**Lord Semaan**</i>, lost in a cave that exits onto my lands. A note reveals his plight and his house affiliation.

##### Entry
Contact established, <i>**Lord Semaan**</i> extends an invitation, and our fruitful discourse unveils his tale as an explorer stranded in these lands.

##### Entry
As the eve of a new year dawns, I, <i>**Gen of House Spectra**</i>, claim these lands of Titania as mine own. Yet, much labor remains.



###### Anno 223 A.G

##### Entry
Encountering an <i>**unknown figure**</i> near the castle waters, I seek information about the lords. The man, unidentified, speaks of the Lord of the Squirrels and a vessel under construction.

##### Entry
Observing the vessel's progress, I discern a need for assistance. Infrastructure I provide, offering respite to the builder.

##### Entry
The builder converses with another figure, possibly the elusive Lord of the Squirrels. I approach, seeking proximity to discern the truth.

##### Entry
The <i>**Lord of the Squirrels**</i> eludes me, departing once again. His lands remain a mystery.

##### Entry
The drydock's completion aids the boat builder. Returning to my lands, <i>**I ponder the lords' fate**</i> and potential clues to their abandonment of the castle...
