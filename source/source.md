###### Anno 222 A.G 

**Entry**
Hark! I find myself upon the <i>**shores of Titania**</i>, a land spoken of with much repute. Rumors led mine ears to tales of a <i>**grand castle**</i> that doth stand as the heart of this realm.

**Entry**
Verily, my quest to locate the castle proved treacherous, for in the mountainous lands of bitter cold and monsters, I found myself <i>**stranded for months**.</i> Seeking sanctuary within the mountain's bosom, the gods of these peaks bestowed upon me the providence needed for survival.

**Entry**
Having endured the mountain's harsh embrace, I have named it <i>**Mount Spectra**</i> in homage to mine ancestors,and now, it is mine dwelling. As I prepare to descend to the lower realms of Titania, I do reflect upon the trials faced.

**Entry**
At last, mine eyes gaze upon the <i>**looming silhouette of the castle**</i>, a formidable presence visible from afar. With caution as my guide, I approach its gates.

**Entry**
The castle, though grand, reveals an open portal, inviting mine exploration across its hallowed grounds.

**Entry**
A survey of the castle and its environs unfolds before me, yet the northern lands remain untrodden.

**Entry**
In my initial observations, I discern the presence of several individuals within the castle walls.Lords, mayhaps, governing this domain. Foremost amongst them is <i>**Luis the Frank**</i>, the master of the castle, overseeing its expansion.

**Entry**
Other lords, in allegiance to Luis the Frank, I spy near the castle's domain. Further investigation is warranted to unveil their identities.

**Entry**
The lords adjacent to the castle appear to possess lands of their own. To the north, the overseer of Titania's village is the alchemically-inclined Lord, <i>**the Master of Reins**</i>, whose ways remain shrouded in mystery.

**Entry**
Whispers reach mine ears of a lord hailing from the <i>**Squirrel lands**</i>, yet the details elude me. His identity and purpose remain obscured.

**Entry**
A warrior lord, clad in <i>**armor resembling that of a frog**</i>, captures mine attention. His name, a riddle unsolved, and his dominion unknown in the realms of Titania.

**Entry**
Having chosen a fertile land to cultivate, I embark on the arduous task of mapping these territories whilst delving into the affairs of the lords. A resource-intensive endeavor, yet a necessary one.

**Entry**
Alas, the lords of Titania vanish from the castle, leaving naught but questions lingering in the air. The reason for their <i>**disappearance**</i> remains an enigma. Have they sailed to distant lands, leaving their dominion unmanned?

**Entry**
The <i>"**Vanishing of the Lords**"</i> marks the year <i>222 A.G.</i>  in the annals of Titania. Evidence suggests the presence of at least two lords dwelling nearby, yet their fates remain unclear.

**Entry**
Exploring the castle surroundings, I uncover the identity of one lord with a fearsome bovine machine - <i>**Johnny the Boy**</i>, a lord of potential peril.

**Entry**
The expansion of my farm complete, I stumble upon a winding path leading to an abode. Could this be the realm of the mysterious <i>**Lord of Squirrels**</i>?

**Entry**
The path reveals the dwelling of another vanished lord to the <i>**southwest**</i>, adding another enigma to the unraveling tale.

**Entry**
Entering what may be the <i>**elusive Lord of the Squirrels**</i>' domain, I find no definitive proof. The search persists.

**Entry**
Castle grounds, seemingly deserted, witness the return of Luis the Frank, evidenced by ongoing expansion. A chance for communication presents itself, though my attempts prove futile.

**Entry**
Months pass with no sign of the lords' return. I extend my territories and fortify my holdings.

**Entry**
Upon my return, I discover <i>**missing**</i> livestock. Further exploration is warranted.

**Entry**
Commencing the construction of a perimeter wall, I unearth a path leading northeast from my farm. A potential link to the vanished animals?

**Entry**
A <i>**revelation**</i> unfolds as I chance upon an edifice, well-kept and stocked. A new lord's domain, it seems, and I set camp to keep vigilant watch.

**Entry**
Despite the lords' continued absence, I fortify my perimeter and intensify illumination.

**Entry**
To my surprise, the mysterious neighbor is none other than <i>**Lord Semaan**</i>, lost in a cave that exits onto my lands. A note reveals his plight and his house affiliation.

**Entry**
Contact established, <i>**Lord Semaan**</i> extends an invitation, and our fruitful discourse unveils his tale as an explorer stranded in these lands.

**Entry**
As the eve of a new year dawns, I, <i>**Gen of House Spectra**</i>, claim these lands of Titania as mine own. Yet, much labor remains.

###### Anno 223 A.G

**Entry**
Encountering an <i>**unknown figure**</i> near the castle waters, I seek information about the lords. The man, unidentified, speaks of the Lord of the Squirrels and a vessel under construction.

**Entry**
Observing the vessel's progress, I discern a need for assistance. Infrastructure I provide, offering respite to the builder.

**Entry**
The builder converses with another figure, possibly the elusive Lord of the Squirrels. I approach, seeking proximity to discern the truth.

**Entry**
The <i>**Lord of the Squirrels**</i> eludes me, departing once again. His lands remain a mystery.

**Entry**
The drydock's completion aids the boat builder. Returning to my lands, <i>**I ponder the lords' fate**</i> and potential clues to their abandonment of the castle...

###### Anno 224 A.G

**Entry**
Many a year hath pass’d since mine eyes last beheld the Castle of Titania, since the grievous hour known as the <i>*Vanishing of the Lords*</i>. I am but a humble mortal, bound by flesh and fleeting time, and have spent these years in mine mountainous keep, studying the *scholarly arts* in hope of discerning some arcane method by which the noble lords might yet be rescued from what seemeth a dread calamity.

**Entry**
Life upon this frozen mount beareth many hardships. The cold bites deep, and provisions scarce sustain. Yet through perseverance, I have raised an edifice not unlike the hydroponic hall once gifted to the castle of Titania. It hath sustained me through many a storm. On occasion, I voyage by water to mine seaside farm, wherefrom I import goods to ensure my survival.
**Entry**
Oft do I wonder what fate befell the halls of Titania. Dost the castle yet stand? Have the lords return’d in secret? I must make ready a journey to those lands, to bear witness with mine own eyes.

**Entry**
As I prepare for voyage, a troubling sight greets me from mine balcony; *smoke and fire* in the far distance. Even from here, that great tower, sentinel of Titania, is visible beneath the heavens. Could it be? Have the lords return’d at last; or hath some new peril taken root?

**Entry**
By water I draw near to the *Port of Titania*. Ash and ruin greet me. A vessel lies smoldering; burnt and broken, adrift and swallowed by flame. To starboard, a refuge doth sit; familiar, yet shrouded in shadow. Methinks it may be the same wraithlike figure I glimpsed in mine last venture. I shall approach with caution, for danger oft wears friendly guise.

**Entry**
From afar, the castle itself seemeth untouched. Yet nature reclaims what man forsakes; *overgrowth* entwines the earth, and the lights that once kept darkness at bay flicker faintly, their magic waning. I shall rekindle them, lest nightfall bring forth the beasts.


**Entry**
Signs of presence I have found. The *storehouses* lay barren, their bounty taken. Yet mine message, left long ago for the returning lords, remaineth unopened and undisturbed. Thus I doubt ‘twas any of the old lords who returned. Another hand hath plundered these grounds.

**Entry**
Grief heavies mine heart. I fear the noble lords—so bold in their questing—hath perished within the *Nether* or wandered beyond the veil in *The End*. Those cursed portals are tombs cloaked as gateways. Yet I shall return once more when the season turns, for I cannot abandon hope. But for now, I must take my leave, for mine own land calleth for care.

**Entry**
I am return’d to mine mountain home, where silence reigns and wind howls through stone. I shall tend to my fields and continue my *studies in the arcane*, holding fast to the faint hope that in my scrolls, or in some forgotten rune, there might be salvation for the *Lords of Titania*. Should the fates allow it, I shall find a way.


###### Anno 225 A.G
**Entry**
Long have I prepared, through many moons, for the quest that now lieth before me. All signs, all whispers, and the remnants of old lead toward one place—the Nether. Thus have I forged a portal, in the manner spoken of in the Forbidden Texts. The hour is upon me. I march onward into fire.

**Entry**
Countless moons have passed, or so it feels, for in the Nether—that accursed realm—there is no slumber, no stars, no time. I know not how long I wandered in that infernal domain. The overworld’s laws are broken here. All things decay, and dread walks unbound. Were it not for the enchantments drawn from mine scholarly toil, I should surely have perished. Fortune smiled when I stumbled upon a portal, far-flung but mercifully functional, that cast me from the Nether’s grasp.

**Entry**
Alas, I am lost. The portal delivered me unto lands unknown, foreign to any chart or star I’ve known. My maps avail me naught. I must either find shelter here or once more brave the Nether’s maw and retrace my path through fire.

**Entry**
Days have dragged their feet through dust and shadow. I prepare again to step into the Nether, for no other path home lies before me. By mine calculations, every pace walked in the Nether measures eightfold in the Overworld. If I be ten-thousand meters astray, then the road back may outlive even mine own years.

**Entry**
Though trapped and wearied, my quest hath borne fruit—I have found signs. Yes, signs! That the Lords of Titania did indeed pass through the Nether. Relics of their journey remain. Their trail is cold, but not erased.

**Entry**
Moons have waned and waxed. Still I lack the means to brave the Nether once more. My exploration of these strange lands hath confirmed what I feared—no passage through the overworld can deliver me home. I have trekked by water and by foot, and every road ends in void. I thank providence that I left marks upon the Nether's stone to guide me, lest I fall once more into a lake of fire.

**Entry**
Today shall be the day I return. Two moon-cycles of preparation hast passed. I have scouted, measured, and gathered. The path lies through the portal. Should I perish, let this be my last testament. Let a copy remain here, in the Frontier Keep of Lord Gen of House Spectra, so that any who find this may know I walked beyond the veil.


###### Anno 226 A.G

**Entry**
I have lost all reckoning of time. In the Nether, there is no sun, no stars—only fire. It was wise to prepare as I did, yet many of mine old markings have faded, swallowed by flame and ash. Progress is slow, but the terrain begins to feel familiar. The gold I bore hath proven most useful, for the boar-headed beasts show me no ire while I wear it.

**Entry**
My supplies dwindle. Potions and enchantments shield me from the heat, yet food runs short. I have partaken of Nether-mushrooms, which nourish the body but ravage the mind with strange visions. Still, I endure. I must. I will return with what I have learned.

**Entry**
At last, I have found the original path. The portal must be near. Though I be weary and half-mad, I press forward. The toll upon my spirit is great, and I know not what time hath become in my absence. Let the portal open swiftly.

**Entry**
Praise be! I have returned to Mount Spectra. Mine own halls await, though changed they seem. I know not how many moon-cycles have passed. The Nether distorts more than space—it shatters time. I shall recover here, pore over my findings, and once more seek the Castle of Titania, come next season.

**Entry**
Time here flows like a raging river. Though mine bones yet move, I feel the burden of age—as if fifty winters have passed. I am but a withered echo of the man who entered the fire. My memories of the Castle fade, as though lost in fog. I fear that more urgent matters now lay claim to my days.

###### Anno 227 A.G

**Entry**
It is now clear that many years have passed, the castle of titania, has been abandoned for many years. My attempts to discover the fate of the lards of titatina has come to a dead end. I have yet to return to the castle, but i suspect it to be infested by monsters. 

**Entry**
My research now concludes that the nether bends time and space, but i do not know of refrence of how much time transpired. If the lords of titania got lost in the nether they might never return to this present, or be lost forever as i almost was. come the end of winter i shall venture to the state of titania, and gather one last time the state of the castle, i fear it is now infested by monsters, since many moons have passed without tending and the enchantments of light have surely mostly faded. Darkeness attracks the monsters..i shall prepare with caution.

**Entry**
It is now the end of winter, and i prepare to travel to the claste of titania, to examine the state of the forsaken castle, i shall make sure erect a stones in remembrance of the missing kin, as i fear they will never return. 

**Entry**
As i approach by water, i confirm my fears, most of the magic lights have faded, the castle of titania now lays in darkness, monster sure lurk around grounds. I shall approach with caution armed with sword and shield to defend my life from the monsters that may lie within.

**Entry**
Zombies, wraiths and skeletons roam the grounds, i slayed most of them and turned the magic lights on a few rooms to keep myself safe. the clase is now deteriorated and run by overgrowth, in the storm water leaks, it is clear, nobody has been in here for many years. I suspect the lords of titania have persished, i shall erect stones in their memory and leave this forsaken castle to its destiny. 

**Entry**
I took me several days to complete retrofit the abandoned room by the stables, this stone walls shall bear the stones remembrance of the missing lords, and shall enchant the room with eternal flams so no monster ever attempt to enter.

The stones read:
Luis the Frank:
The Master of Reins
Johnny the Boy
The Lord of Squirrels
The Green Warrior

"If you bone shall still live,
your castle abandoned in time
shall fade yet this eternal flame shall not,
Thy thrones lie cold, yet this flame warm ethernal.
remembered you shall be in the room accrros time"

Lord Gen of House Spectra, your ethernal kind of the brotherood of Titania.

**Entry**
I have done all that i can to preserve the memory of those lost in time, i shall now return to keep in the mountanous ice, and live the restof my days in search of new meaning.
